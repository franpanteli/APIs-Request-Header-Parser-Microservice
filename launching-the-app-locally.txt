Instructions for Running the Project Locally:

1. Navigate to Your Project Directory:
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your project is located.
   Use the following command:
   cd path/to/your/project

2. Install Dependencies:
   If you haven't done this yet, install the project dependencies by running:
   npm install

3. Run the Server:
   Start your server using the following command:
   node server.js
   You should see a message indicating that the app is listening on a specific port.

4. Access the Local App:
   Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your server.js file).

5. Test the API Endpoint Locally:
   Open a new tab in your browser or use a tool like curl or Postman to visit:
   http://localhost:3000/api/whoami
   You should receive a JSON response containing information about the client (IP address, language, and software).

Now, you can interact with your project locally. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to let me know!

First time: 
	-> cd into the repository 
	-> npm install 
	-> node server.js
	-> http://localhost:3000 in the browser 

Every other time:
	-> cd into the repository 
	-> node server.js
	-> In the browser 
		-> http://localhost:3000 <- this serves the index.html file 
		-> http://localhost:3000/api/whoami <- this hosts the micro service 
			-> If you use this URL, then you are effectively the client making the call to the browser
