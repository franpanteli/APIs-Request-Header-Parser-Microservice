Running the project locally:

1. git clone https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-Request-Header-Parser-Microservice-Project.git

2. cd into this directory 

3. npm install
	-> This installs the npm dependencies 

3. node server.js 
	-> This runs the server - after this is run, the server should be listening to the 3000 port (or its backup port)

4. http://localhost:3000 
	-> Go to this URL in the browser (or to the relevant one, depending on the port being used)

5. http://localhost:3000/api/whoami
   	-> Then go to this URL in the browser 
   	-> This returns a JSON response containing information about the client (IP address, language, and software)

First time: 
	-> cd into the repository 
	-> npm install 
	-> node server.js
	-> http://localhost:3000 in the browser 

Every other time:
	-> cd into the repository 
	-> node server.js
	-> In the browser 
		-> http://localhost:3000 <- this serves the index.html file 
		-> http://localhost:3000/api/whoami <- this hosts the micro service 
			-> If you use this URL, then you are effectively the client making the call to the browser
